in this code we have tree func to build this app:

1. get ---> to get current count   
    - everyone see this func and can call it and have view of it

2. increase ---> to increment current count by 1 ---> 
    - everyone can see this function and just can call it

3. decrease---> to decrement current count by 1
    - everyone can see this function and just can call it

if our current count is 0
we can decrease it because the result will be negative
